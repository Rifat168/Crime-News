<h1 style="color:red">About :</h1>
<p style="color:white">Crime Portal is crime based web portal where anyone from anywhere can post about crime which is 
happening or happened or should be happened in distant future simultaneously keeping himself/herself unexposed

details to create an account, using a username which should be pseudo name and a password. 
Then The Admin panel will grant the request of the user.

<h1 style="color:red">Summary and Keywords :</h1>
<p style="color:white">Crime news is an abundant staple in modern media coverage. Nowhere is this more evident than in 
the newspaper medium, which often faces fewer constraints with respect to space and time compared to other formats 
(e.g., television), thereby enabling more stories to be generated. As most people will rely on the news format for 
their information about crime, it is imperative that such stories be presented factually and within the scope of their 
magnitude. Yet as research has indicated, this often is not the journalistic practice as it relates to crime news. 
Instead, there is often a disproportionate amount of crime presented in the news, with specific attention dedicated 
to the most serious of crimes, such as homicide, even though these occur least often. Still, the focus of such reporting 
is often centered upon the most extreme and sensational cases, further distorting the reality of crime. A number of 
factors influence these selection decisions, including (but certainly not limited to) victim characteristics and 
agenda-setting practices by news organizations. The way in which these stories are constructed and framed also 
contributes to the creation of social problems as they are perceived by members of society. Consequently, there are 
broader impacts of the coverage of crime news in newspapers, particularly as it relates to audience effects.</p>
